# mlkit-bench

This repository provides tools and benchmark programs for the purpose
of benchmarking [MLKit](https://github/melsman/mlkit) executables
across versions (and configurations) and against
[MLton](http://mlton.org)-generated executables.

Here is an overview of the tools in this repository:

- `mlkit-bench`. This tool is what actually coordinates compilation
  and execution of benchmark programs. The output of the command is a
  json-file, which can then be processed by `mlkit-bench-press` or
  `mlkit-charting`.

- `mlkit-bench-press`. This tool allows for inspection and querying of
  the json-file generated by `mlkit-bench`.

- `mlkit-charting`. This tool is useful for charting the MLKit
  performance on benchmarks over time. The tool makes use of `smltojs`
  to create a web-site that allows for investing the performance
  characteristics of various versions of MLKit. The [web-site is hosted at Github](https://elsman.com/mlkit-bench/).


__Notice:__ A useful setup is to have the MLKit sources checked-out at a sister-repository:

    ~/gits/mlkit-bench/
    ~/gits/mlkit/

## Benchmark programs

Currently, there are two sets of benchmarks:

1. [Sequential benchmarks](benchmarks). These benchmarks feature a
   variety of Standard ML programs, ranging over small
   micro-benchmarks to more involved benchmarks.

2. [Parallel benchmarks](par-benchmarks). These benchmarks make use of
   the parallel threading possibilities of MLKit, which features a
   fork-join model for parallism combined with region-based memory
   management.
